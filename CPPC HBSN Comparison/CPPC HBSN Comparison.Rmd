Cappex and Hobson contract details are as follows:

* Cappex - annual contract,  November - October, 16,500 USD

* Hobson - 29,643.02 USD

  + Intersect Awareness: annual contract, for the enhanced college profile and counselor community: October - September
  
  + Intersect Connection-Active match competitive: 6 mos: August - January
  
  + Intersect Connection-Active match self matching: 6 mos: August - January

```{r fig-fullwidth, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="This is a full width plot.", fig.fullwidth=TRUE, fig.height=2, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

#代码段选项`fig.fullwidth = TRUE`可以使得一幅图占用全部页宽，例如：
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~ cut)
```

## Margin Figures

Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte's work. To place figures in the margin you can use the **knitr** chunk option `fig.margin = TRUE`. For example:

```{r fig-margin, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = "MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.", fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}

mtcars2 <- mtcars
mtcars2$am <- factor(
  mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual')
)
ggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```



## Sidenotes



If you'd like to place ancillary information in the margin without the sidenote mark (the superscript number), you can use the `margin_note()` function from **tufte** in an inline R expression. `r margin_note("This is a margin note.  Notice that there is no number preceding the note.")` This function does not process the text with Pandoc, so Markdown syntax will not work here. If you need to write anything in Markdown syntax, please use the `marginfigure` block described previously.





## Tables

You can use the `kable()` function from the **knitr** package to format tables that integrate well with the rest of the Tufte handout style. The table captions are placed in the margin like figures in the HTML output.
