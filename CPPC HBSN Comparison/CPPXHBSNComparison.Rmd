# Findings





```{r fig-fullwidth, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="This is a full width plot.", fig.fullwidth=TRUE, fig.height=2, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# In general,
#     \href{https://blog.adstage.io/facebook-ads-benchmarks}{{\color{blue}{\underline{FB Newsfeed }}}} CTR overall experienced a 24% drop from July, 2017 - July, 2018.

## Plots



#代码段选项`fig.fullwidth = TRUE`可以使得一幅图占用全部页宽，例如：
# ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
#   facet_grid(~ cut)
```



```{r fig-margin, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = "MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.", fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}

# mtcars2$am <- factor(
#   mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual')
# )
# ggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +
#   geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
#   theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
